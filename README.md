Overview of the Project

Project:Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Netflix Dataset

Objective:
The objective of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data. It involves summarizing key statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying trends or anomalies that can inform decision-making or further analysis. EDA helps in understanding the structure and quality of the data, guiding subsequent modeling or business strategies.

Key Activities:
Key activities of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset include:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data is in a usable format.
2. Data Visualization: Creating plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, box plots, scatter plots) to visualize distributions, trends, and relationships within the data

3. Correlation Analysis:Identifying correlations between population figures across different years.

Technologies used:
. Python:The primary programming language for data analysis.
. panadas:used for data manipulation and analysis
. matplotlib:Employed for creating static,animated and interactive visulaizations
. seaborn:utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and interactive and attractive.

Key insights:

1. Content Distribution: Identifying the distribution of content types (e.g., movies vs. TV shows) and their popularity over time, which can reveal trends in viewer preferences.
   
2. Genre Popularity: Analyzing which genres are most prevalent and most watched, helping to understand audience preferences and guide content creation or acquisition strategies.

3. Release Patterns: Observing trends in the release dates of content, such as spikes during certain periods (e.g., holidays or weekends), and how these correlate with viewership or subscriber growth.

4. Geographic Insights:Identifying how content preferences vary by region, which can inform targeted marketing and localization strategies.

5. Rating and Age Distribution: Examining the distribution of content ratings (e.g., PG, R) and how they correlate with viewership demographics, helping to tailor content offerings to different audience segments.

6. Content Longevity:Understanding how long content remains popular after its release, which can inform decisions about content rotation or removal from the platform.

7. User Engagement Patterns: Analyzing how different types of content (e.g., genres, release years) correlate with user engagement metrics like watch time, completion rates, or re-watches.

8. Trend Identification:Detecting emerging trends in content types or viewer behavior that could influence future content strategies or platform features.
